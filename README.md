# Moving Particles

An interactive canvas that renders bouncing particles in an enclosed space using the [processing graphical library](https://processing.org/). The particles are textured with the planets in our solar system. When the user clicks their mouse on the screen, a randomly generated planet will spawn at the cursor position and shoot outwards with a random direction and speed, where it will start bouncing off of walls while under the effect of gravity.
